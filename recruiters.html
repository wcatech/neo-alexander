            <h2>The Reality</h2>
            <p class="profile-text">
                You spend hours on research, follow-ups, and admin work that keeps you from what actually drives revenue: building relationships and closing placements.
            </p>
            <p class="profile-text" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                What if you had an assistant that handled all of it? Research, candidate tracking, email drafting, reminders — everything you never got around to — while you focus on the conversations that matter.
